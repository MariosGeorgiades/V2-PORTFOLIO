# 🌐 Personal Portfolio v2.0

Welcome to the central hub of my work. This is my second-generation portfolio website, designed to showcase my journey through **Competitive Programming**, **Systems Engineering**, and **Maritime Machine Learning**.

**Live Demo:** [mariosgeorgiades.github.io](https://mariosgeorgiades.github.io/)

### 🚀 The Vision
This portfolio is more than just a resume; it is a reflection of my engineering philosophy: **"I don't study code for the sake of theory; I master technology to build solutions for real-world scenarios."**

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Architecture:** Responsive Design, Optimized Asset Loading
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages



### 📈 Evolution
Compared to my first portfolio, version 2.0 focuses on:
1. **Systems Depth:** Highlighting my ability to manage hardware and servers, not just front-end code.
2. **Professional Narrative:** Clearly communicating my identity as a founder and systems-level thinker.
3. **Optimized UX:** A cleaner, more professional interface that gets straight to the code.
